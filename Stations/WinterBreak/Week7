The bikeshare traffic can be thought of as a network. Each stations can be as nodes in the network and each stations has an edge between them. The ridership can be thought as the flow between two nodes along edges.

 We can computer traffic matrix for each hour easily as the net out-flowes and net in-flowes can be measured using ridership data.
