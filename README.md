# Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis
In this project, I leveraged several regression models and network models to the [Washington D.Câ€™s Bikeshare ridership data.](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

### EDA analyis on ridership data
* [Post1](http://yunhaolucky.github.io/bikeshare/2014/09/05/week1.html) : Explantory Data analyis on ridership data from April - June 2012.

### Hourly Count data analysis on Kaggle
* [Post2] EDA and Linear Regression on [Kaggle's Data](http://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
* [Post3] Explore Interactions and Model Selection
* [Post4] Poisson Regression and Other Distribution
* [Post5] More on Poisson Regression

### Traffic between Station
* [Post6] EDA on Ridership data(`duration`,`speed`,`location`)
* [Post7] Analyze `# of bikes and empty slots` in each station
* [Post8]

### Other
* Animation of ridership [demo](http://nameless-mountain-3948.herokuapp.com/) / [code](/Stations/web-demo)  
  I build an animation using javascript to show the traffic between different stations in one day.
* Data Scraper  [code](/station_scraper)
  I got `# of bikes` from [Capital ridership](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) into a postgresql database.
