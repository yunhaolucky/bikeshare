### P(S,E,T) = P(E,T|S) * P(S) ###
I use all ridership `Registered` and `Weekday` data from `April to June in 2014`. There are `502191` rows.

#### P(S): # of bikes starting from each station ####
```
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
   5     212     956    1564    2440   13960
```

From the map, We notice that the location of the station effects # of rides significantly.

#### P(E,T|S) = P(E|S,T) * P(T|S) ####
There are `321` stations that have riderships. I pick 10 stations according to how many rides starts from that station.

##### P(T|S) ####

We see no obvious pattern in the above graphs. Therefore, we need a model of time for each station.

`N(T|S)~Poisson(λ)` `λ~f(S,s.lat,s.long)`

##### P(E|S,T) #####
Given Starting station and time, we can predict the ending point.
E  = F(T,S) = F(T,s.lat,s.long)





#### P(E) ####
```
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
   4     231     795    1564    2592   13350
```

The distribution of End point is not very different from the distribution of Start point.
