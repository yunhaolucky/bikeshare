## Improvement from last post ##
### `season` variable ###
* In the previous post, I find some unusual pattern of temperature in different season.
* In the original data, `season` is defined as the quater in a year`(Winter (1 - 3) Spring (4 - 6) Summer(7 - 9) Fall(10 - 12))`
* To represent the condition in Washington better, I redefine the `season` variable as`(Winter = (12 - 2) Spring(3 - 5) Summer(6 - 8) Fall(9 - 11))` according to [this post](http://www.washingtondc.com/weather/).
* This change improve `rmsle` from `1.03653 to 0.90802`.

### `datetime` in linear regression ###
* Datetime is a `POSIXct` variable and is treated as a continuous variable in linear regression.
* It is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT.
* This explains why the coefficient is small but the relationship is significant.

## Linear Regression with interactions ##
### Pairwise ###
I do linear regression on all pairs of variables in train by running
```
train.lm <- lm(count ~ .*., data=count.feature)
```
Result output:
* Train
  * [summary_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_summary.txt)
  * [anova_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_anova.txt)
  * `rmsle for train = 0.5867038 `
  * `R-squared = 0.8983,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.893`
  * We can see from the output that all variable(itself or its interaction) has significant impact on the count.
  * `holiday` and `workingday` have less significant level than other variables.
* Prediction(after set min = 10)
  * `rmsle = 0.66178` rank 685/1019
  * Performs better than 1-way lm`rmsle = 1.03653`

### 3-variables interactions ###
We see pairwise linear regression predicts better than one-way lm. Could 3-way perform even better than pairwise lm?
```
train.lm <- lm(count ~ .^2, data=count.feature)
```

  * There are 3462 coefficient in regression. (Some of variables are not included due to singularities)
  * [summary_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_3_summary.txt)
  * [anova_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_3_anova.txt)
  * `Multiple R-squared:  0.9629,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.9454 `
  * However, the real `rmsle = 3.99`. This model is overfitting.

### `Register` and `Casual` with interaction ###

In previous post, when using `count = registered + casual`, we get better predictions. I apply this method in pair-wise linear regression. (To avoid outfitting, I evaluated the model by cross-validation.)

Col | Casual  | Registered | Combination(Count)
----|------------- | -------------|------
summary_output|[summary_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_casual_summary.txt)|[summary_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_registered_summary.txt)
anova_output|[anova_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_casual_summary.txt)|[anova_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/master/Week3/lm_2_registered_anova.txt)
R_squared|0.8491|0.8933|0.8983
R_squared (cross_validation)|0.8283779|0.8774045|
rmlse(train)|0.9985498|0.5746182|0.5733307
rmsle (cross_validation)|1.049515|0.6116291|

* Prediction `rmsle =  0.67749` which is slightly worse than the model that predicts count directly.


## Explore Interactions ##
#### `Season` ####
I take `season` as an example to discuss the consistency between interaction plot and the regression result.

```
*  The significant interactions are:
  * Count : `winter*atemp & summer*atemp`,`winter*atemp & fall*atemp`
  * Registered:`winter*atemp & summer*atemp`
  * Casual :`winter*atemp & summer*atemp`
* We can also see the difference in the plot.
* Therefore, `season*atemp` should be included.

```
* From plot and output, we see `season*temp` has significant relationship with count.
* However, `temp`'s significance is smaller than that of `atemp`. The correlation between `temp` and `atemp` is strong.
* I try to remove `temp` from model run pairwise linear regression.
  * `r_squared(cv) = 0.8819059`
  * `r_squared(cv) = 0.6020635` which is provides ` 0.00457` better result.

* The plot oscillates a lot but the general trend is that bigger humidity leads to smaller count. (Clustering might be helpful)
* It is hard to find the interaction from the plot, but the output tells that `season*humidity` should be included.

* Although we see interactions in the plot, the regression output tells that `windspeed*season` is not significant.

![](https://googledrive.com/host/0B47woKFE0zXeZ01RNVh3RFFuOFE/hour_season.png)
* Interaction`day*season` is obvious in `casual` plot. The interaction is less obvious in `registered`.

[Other_Interaction_Plot](https://github.com/yunhaolucky/bikeshare/blob/master/Week3/interaction_plot.markdown)
* From the above analysis, we know it is hard to determine iteractions from plot and we need more accurate ways to select variables.

## Select Variables ##
### All subsets in Pairwise Linear Regression##
I write a variable selection function to select variables.(I did not use leaps packages because some factors have too many levels.)
* Algorithm
  * Test each subset of 11 variables
  * Use 5-cross_validation
  * Run pairwise linear regression on each subset
  * Pick subset with the highest R-squared and Lowest rmsle for each subset size.
The output is as following:

|Size|rmsle|r-squared|Best Selection(Best Rmsle)|
|----|---|---|---|
|11|0.6100475|0.8839998|{"datetime","season","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","atemp","humidity","humidity","hour","weekday"}|
|10|0.600389|0.8827981|{"datetime","season","holiday","workingday","weather","atemp","humidity","humidity","hour","weekday"}|
|9|0.5657392|0.8661472|{"datetime","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","humidity","humidity","hour","weekday"}|
|8|0.5568338|0.8618536|{"datetime","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","humidity","humidity","hour"}|
|7|0.5518104|0.8622624|{"datetime","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","humidity","hour"}|
|6|0.549219|0.8598366|{"datetime","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","hour"}|  
|5|0.5503646|0.8577884|{"datetime","workingday","weather","temp","hour"}|
|4|0.5619635|0.8381479|{"datetime","workingday","temp","hour"}|
|3|0.5968234|0.7346989|{"hour","temp","weekday"}|
|2|0.7075641|0.5938777|{"hour","weekday"}|
*  `rmsle` decreases first when size gets bigger then increase after size = 6.
* `r-squared` keeps increasing when n increases.
* Best Solution is (n = 6){"datetime","holiday","workingday","weather","temp","hour"}
 * prediction rmsle = 0.63953 (compared to previous best 0.66178)

## Poisson Distribution ##
* Poisson Distribution is used to expresses the probability of a specific number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
* In this problem, what we predict is the number of counts occur in 1 hour, which fits the description of Possion Distribution.
* But in this case, the number of counts might not be independent of the time since the last event.

```r
train.glm <- glm(count ~ 1+., data=count.feature,family = poisson(link = "log"))
test.predict.glm = 2^predict(train.glm, test)
```
However, all predictions is smaller than 10 and `rmsle > 1.5`

## Future plan ##
1. The relationship between `count` and other variables might be polynomial with higher degree. Non-linear regression could be an option.
2. Poisson Distribution.
